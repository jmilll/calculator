## Motivation

The purpose of this project was to learn and understand Javascript events and manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) through user interactions.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* HTML / CSS

## Features

* 2 Input types: numpad/keyboard, or point & click.
* Visual feedback: when using the keyboard, calculator buttons highlight when pressed.
* Previous operand: shows previous input and operator chosen.
* Continuous input: No need to hit "=" just press the next operator - the numbers will crunch, the result will show above, and it's ready for more numbers.
